--- Skip Authentication for Local Backends ---

Description: This patch documents that NO CHANGES are needed.
The existing code already correctly skips authentication for non-NEAR AI backends.

File: src/main.rs (lines 211-215)

Existing code (ALREADY CORRECT):
```rust
// Session-based auth is only needed for NEAR AI backend without an API key.
if config.llm.backend == ironclaw::config::LlmBackend::NearAi
    && config.llm.nearai.api_key.is_none()
{
    session.ensure_authenticated().await?;
}
```

This conditional ensures that:
- Ollama users: No auth required ✓
- OpenAI-compatible users: No NEAR AI auth required ✓
- OpenAI/Anthropic users: No NEAR AI auth required ✓
- NEAR AI with API key: No browser OAuth required ✓
- NEAR AI without API key: OAuth flow triggered ✓

NO PATCH NEEDED - The code is already local-first friendly.
